# Abstract

Bicycle-sharing programs have grown in quantity and popularity in cities all around the world during the last decade. Users can borrow bicycles for a fee on a very short-term basis through bicycle-sharing programs. The bicycle-sharing system has grown in popularity in numerous cities across the world in recent years. This allows users to borrow a bike from point A and return it to point B in Washington D.C, USA, however, they may just go on a ride and return it to the same area. Regardless, each bike may serve a number of people each day. It's a system that allows you to hire bicycles at an affordable price.

A user of the system may easily reach a dock inside the system to unlock or return bicycles, thanks to advances in information technology. These technologies also generate a plethora of data that may be utilized to investigate how people use these bike-sharing systems.


# Introduction

Users can take the bike from one location (station) and return it to another place (another station) that belongs to the system when their trip is over, or they can return to the same starting point again, depending on the system.

It then asks the user if they want to examine the raw data (5 rows of data at first) or not after receiving the user input. The program prints the following information after receiving the input:

*Date
*Average Temperature
*Minimum Temperature
*Maximum Temperature
*Observed Temperature
*Precipitation
*Wind and climate details
*Total Customers
*Holiday details
*Registered users details
*Casual users details


It should also be noted that each city gives distinct information, as shown in the printout above. Even though the information is the same, the column names and formatting may change. Trim and sanitize the data to make things as easy as possible when we get to the real exploration. Cleaning the data ensures that data formats are uniform across columns, whilst trimming the data focuses solely on the areas of the data we're most interested in, making exploration simpler.
