# Abstract

Bicycle-sharing programs have grown in quantity and popularity in cities all around the world during the last decade. Users can borrow bicycles for a fee on a very short-term basis through bicycle-sharing programs. The bicycle-sharing system has grown in popularity in numerous cities across the world in recent years. This allows users to borrow a bike from point A and return it to point B in Washington D.C, USA, however, they may just go on a ride and return it to the same area. Regardless, each bike may serve a number of people each day. It's a system that allows you to hire bicycles at an affordable price.

A user of the system may easily reach a dock inside the system to unlock or return bicycles, thanks to advances in information technology. These technologies also generate a plethora of data that may be utilized to investigate how people use these bike-sharing systems.
